fae fdaef as ef sss  ss Now you saw, that on saving and loading it doesn't save cursor position like your other fancy editors.
You can of course delete text, both backwards by backspace or by delete forward You can also change font size by Ctrl+Mouse scroll. But text won't look so good if not on original font size, as font is loaded only once at start.
Who would even like that, changing font size ??


Now would you like to see it's features?
As you can see, you could load it from a file named "test.txt" on load.
You may be surprised that it also saves, but to that same file on close.
